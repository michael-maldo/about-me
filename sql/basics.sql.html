\echo select * from weather;
select * from weather;

\echo SELECT city, temp_lo, temp_hi, prcp, cur_date FROM weather;
SELECT city, temp_lo, temp_hi, prcp, cur_date FROM weather;


\echo You can write expressions, not just simple column references, in the select list. For example, you can do
\echo SELECT city, (temp_hi+temp_lo)/2 AS temp_avg, cur_date FROM weather;
\echo

SELECT city, (temp_hi+temp_lo)/2 AS temp_avg, cur_date FROM weather;




\echo A query can be “qualified” by adding a WHERE clause that specifies which rows are wanted. The WHERE clause contains a Boolean (truth value) expression, and only rows for which the Boolean expression is true are returned. The usual Boolean operators (AND, OR, and NOT) are allowed in the qualification

\echo
\echo SELECT * FROM weather WHERE city = 'San Francisco' AND prcp > 0.0;
SELECT * FROM weather WHERE city = 'San Francisco' AND prcp > 0.0;

SELECT * FROM weather WHERE city NOT = 'San Francisco' ;



\echo You can request that the results of a query be returned in sorted order:
\echo

\echo SELECT * FROM weather ORDER BY city;
SELECT * FROM weather ORDER BY city;
--SELECT * FROM weather ORDER BY city DESC;


\echo In this example, the sort order isn't fully specified, and so you might get the San Francisco rows in either order. But you'd always get the results shown above if you do
\echo SELECT * FROM weather ORDER BY city, temp_lo;
SELECT * FROM weather ORDER BY city desc, temp_lo desc;


\echo SELECT * FROM weather ORDER BY city desc, temp_lo desc;
SELECT * FROM weather ORDER BY city desc, temp_lo desc;


\echo You can request that duplicate rows be removed from the result of a query:
\echo
\echo SELECT DISTINCT city FROM weather;
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM weather;


\echo using NOT

\echo select * from weather WHERE city NOT IN ('San Francisco', 'New York');
select * from weather WHERE city NOT IN ('San Francisco', 'New York');
